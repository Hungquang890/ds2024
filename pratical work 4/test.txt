MapReduce is a framework for processing parallelizable problems 
across large datasets using a large number of computers (nodes),
collectively referred to as a cluster (if all nodes are on the 
same local network and use similar hardware) or a grid (if the 
nodes are shared across geographically and administratively distributed 
systems, and use more heterogeneous hardware).
